WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

Created a search feature incorporated with an API to look for a citys lat/long and find its weather forecast

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

Pulled data from api object according to each criteria

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

Created a switch to change class according to UVI value

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

Created a for loop to apply same methods as above to 5 containers for each future day that week

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city

Each city is sent to local storage and is then oulled with a button being created for it that allows it to be called again (page needs to be refreshed otherwise all cities will stack)
